Hey! If you're reading this, you've downloaded the source code and assets for my game, "No Man's Asteroids".
Included in these folders are things not seen in the actual game. Tons of unused graphics, some audio I didn't end up putting in (but was made for this game)


 ##About the game                            


No Man's Asteroids is a definite 'for fun' game, but it was made for a few very real purposes:


#	1. I have no decent portfolio pieces, and I needed to make something I could be proud of.
#	2. I'm unsure of my fan following, and needed a "test release" to gage the state of things.
#	3. Taking it easy sometimes is extremely needed for the human psyche. This serves as a bit of a "break
	   for me.

	If you're interested in more in-depth reasoning, Please refer to these blog posts on my site:

 ## Use of game assets                              


	I'll be including a specific licensing with this project on Github, but in case you're confused, on
	whether you can use these assets and code in your project, please refer to these (vague) guidelines.

#	1. You can use any of my assets without restrictions, commercial or otherwise. In other words, any use
	of these files is generally fine by me. If you're unsure, shoot me an email or tweet, and I'll let you know.
	
#	2. You must credit me in any re-release of these files, code, or assets. A link to my website (http://Enemby.com/),
	or something similar to that is fine. 

#	3. Be excellent to eachother!

	Please note that some audio in the "Sound" folder was not made by me. Please check the "Attribution" file
	in that folder.

## Thanks to:                                      

	
#	1. I'll always appreciate the local utah game development community. It's important for a project to 
	be able to ask for feedback and show off things without restriction, and this community served that 
	purpose for me.
	
#	2. The original creators of the "Asteriods" game in 1979. (Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh.). These
	games formed the basis of what the video game industry is today, and this game especially has an interesting
	history.
	
#	3. Anyone who actually read this whole thing. (That's you!)
